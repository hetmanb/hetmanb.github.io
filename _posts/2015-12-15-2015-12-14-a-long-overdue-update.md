## A long overdue update... 

Since its been a few months since I started this page - I thought it might be prudent to actually sit down and try to post something. 

First things first - if you want to check out some of the projects I've worked on, a brief description and link to them can be found [here. ](http://hetmanb.com/projects.html) Typically these will be links to little RShiny applications that I've put together. I'll also try to post [photo albums](http://hetmanb.com/_photos/) from time to time, so watch out for that! 

Some folk from my lab (myself included) recently attended a conference in Rotorua, New Zealand. We delivered a number of oral presentations, all of which were well-received. Mine seemed to be the only one that suffered from technical difficulties (note to self: less animations next time!) but nevertheless, I was approached by a few folks interested in the work, so I'm happy with the way things turned out. A copy of my presenation slides can be found here.

After the conference, a couple of us rented a car and drove from the North Island down to the South Island, hitting a number of stops along the way. I'll talk about some of the highlights of the trip in another post.
