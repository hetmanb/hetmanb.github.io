Here's a couple computery projects I've been (slowly) developing using R-Shiny. Shiny has been a great platform for developing and testing out analyses using R, and I'm repeatedly impressed and surprised at the frequency and quality of new packages being written that make R accessible for people who have little to no coding expertise or experience (like me!).

--- [**EpiQuant**](http://www.hetmanb.com/epiquant) (epidemiology quantifier) is a web-app that I developed which for the purpose of quantifying the relationships between bacterial isolates, based on their epidemiology.   

--- [**ShinyStats**](http://www.hetmanb.com/shinystats) is a work-in-progress that I started to put together after seeing how far shiny has come in terms of cool data visualizations. It's built using the shinydashboard package, and several R packages that help to integrate javascript (which I don't have any experience with) into shiny development. I'll be adding more things to this as time goes on, but for now, its pretty basic.
