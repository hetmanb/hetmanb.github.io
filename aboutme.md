subtitle: A little about me

My name is Ben Hetman. I'm currently a MSc. grad-student at the University of Lethbridge. But if I think about it, that's probably the worst way to describe myself. More appropriately: 

- I can (*read* have) re-watch any episode of [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) pretty much at any time of day, and quote most of the iconic phrases from the episode as soon as I see which one it is. 
- I like homemade things.. or at least home*brewed* things. From both angles of the science, and mostly the *drinking*, I love making homemade beer, wine and cider, not in any particular order. 
- Mountains excite me, as does yummy food. Mountains and yummy food at the same time is best.

### my cv

In order to give my hand a try at writing something in Latex, I wrote something in Latex, using a template I found online (I'll try to post a link later when I definitely remember.) [Curriculum Vitae](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bc2qny5wapd4opn/benjamin.hetman.cv.pdf?dl=1)
